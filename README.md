= CH552 USB HID, Mouse and Keyboard Library for Arduino =

This library allows an Arduino board with CH552 as interface to act as a USB Mouse and Keyboard.


To prepare the CH552 use the CH55xDuino library, install it by placing this link under your preferences in the Arduino IDE(Windows only for now)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atc1441/atc1441.github.io/master/package_ch55xduino_index.json
and install the CH55xDuino library via the Boards Manager.

Use the Zadig tool to install the libusb-win32 driver for the CH55x in Bootloader mode to make it accessable via Arduino. 

Then open the "CH552_Interface" Example and click on upload to flash it to the CH55x connected via usb.
